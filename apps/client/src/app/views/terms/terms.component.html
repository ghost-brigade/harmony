      <p>
        Welcome! Harmony is a platform that brings people together over shared
        experiences and gives everyone a place to belong. We’re happy you’re
        here.

      <h2>
        Age requirements and responsibility of parents and legal guardians
      </h2>
      <p>
        By accessing our services, you confirm that you’re at least 13 years old
        and meet the minimum age required by the laws in your country. We
        maintain a list of minimum ages around the world as a resource for you,
        but we aren’t able to guarantee that it is always accurate. If you are
        old enough to access our services in your country, but not old enough to
        have authority to consent to our terms, your parent or legal guardian
        must agree to our terms on your behalf. Please ask your parent or legal
        guardian to read these terms with you. If you’re a parent or legal
        guardian, and you allow your child (who meets the minimum age for your
        country) to use the services, then these terms also apply to you and
        you’re responsible for your child’s activity on the services, including
        purchases made by them. For more information on purchases, see
        "Harmony’s Paid Services" below.
      </p>
      <h2>What you can expect from us</h2>
      <p>
        Harmony is a platform that brings people together over shared
        experiences and gives everyone a place to belong. To do that, we provide
        different digital spaces where you can connect with other Harmony users
        and communities. Harmony users communicate primarily via “servers,”
        which are digital spaces made up of different types of channels. Text
        channels allow users to interact via text-based messages, as well as
        images, GIFs, emoji, and other uploadable media. Voice channels allow
        users to communicate by voice and/or streaming video. We’re always
        evolving our services, and we may create other types of channels in the
        future!
      </p>
      <p>
        Users create servers, and users choose which servers to join and who
        their “friends” are. Server owners and server admins control the server
        permissions and rules, including establishing membership requirements
        and creating custom roles and what those roles can do within the server.
        Server owners and admins also control whether to make their server
        available in Server Discovery, whether to publish their server invite
        link on public websites, whether to enable community growth and safety
        features, and whether to add bots or other apps. These permissions, like
        the size of a server, may change over time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Harmony is designed to make communicating with the people you want to
        speak to as easy as possible. Posts appear in text channels in the order
        in which they’re made. Voice and video communication also happens in
        real time. Harmony was also designed to make it easy to share what
        you’re up to. You can stream what you’re doing on your device, or you
        can share your status, including what game you're playing, what song
        you’re listening to (if you link a music account), and more. Sharing
        gameplay is fundamental to the Harmony experience, so it’s turned on by
        default. But you can turn it off in your Settings at any time, and
        you’re in control of whether you connect other accounts to Harmony.
      </p>
      <p>
        Harmony’s services may be personalized to each user based on their
        activity, so that you can see content and communities that may be of
        interest to you. You can control whether and to what extent Harmony
        personalizes your experience in your Settings.
      </p>
      <p>
        We’re actively developing new features and products to improve Harmony.
        As part of these efforts, we may add or remove features, start offering
        new services, or stop offering some services entirely (or just in some
        places or for some users) if they no longer make sense from a business
        perspective or create risk for Harmony, our users, or other third
        parties. While we try to avoid disruptions, we cannot guarantee that
        there will not be an outage or change to the services, and your content
        may not be retrievable due to such outages or changes. We are not liable
        for any such outages or service changes.
